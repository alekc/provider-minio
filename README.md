# Provider MinIO

`provider-minio` is a [Crossplane](https://crossplane.io/) provider that
is built using [Upjet](https://github.com/crossplane/upjet) code
generation tools and exposes XRM-conformant managed resources for the
MinIO API.

## Getting Started

### Fix for make generate
The Minio Provider Terraform documentation has a missing block that will cause the `make generate` command to fail 
with the following error:

```bash
scraper: error: Failed to scrape Terraform provider metadata: cannot scrape Terraform registry: failed to scrape 
resource metadata from path: ../.work/aminueza/minio/docs/resources/accesskey.md: failed to find the prelude of the document using the xpath expressions: //text()[contains(., "description") and contains(., "page_title")]
```

to fix it run the following command:

```bash
broken_doc_file=".work/aminueza/minio/docs/resources/accesskey.md"
echo '---
# generated by https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-docs
page_title: "confluent_ksql_cluster Resource - terraform-provider-confluent"
subcategory: ""
description: |-

---' | cat - $broken_doc_file > temp && mv temp $broken_doc_file
```

Install the provider by using the following command after changing the image tag
to the [latest release](https://marketplace.upbound.io/providers/alekc/provider-minio):
```
crossplane xpkg install provider xpkg.crossplane.io/alekc/provider-minio:v0.1.0
```

Alternatively, you can use declarative installation:
```
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: pkg.crossplane.io/v1
kind: Provider
metadata:
  name: provider-minio
spec:
  package: xpkg.crossplane.io/alekc/provider-minio:v0.1.0
EOF
```

Notice that in this example Provider resource is referencing ControllerConfig with debug enabled.

You can see the API reference [here](https://doc.crds.dev/github.com/alekc/provider-minio).
